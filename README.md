# Landing Page Project

## project description

This project is a dynamic landing page i implemented all the **javaScript** code and adjust some **HTML** code.
I built navigation dynamically as an unordered list.
Started with an empty ul and dynamically built navigation using the **appendChild()** built-in function, and **innerHTML** and **for of loop**.

I cleared which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page by detecting the element location using the **.getBoundingClientRect()** and **add()** and **remove()** built-in functions .

I implemented a code that when clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scroll to the appropriate section by using **.addEventListener()** and **.scrollIntoView()** built-in functions.
